        <p>
            <br><br>I was born in Upstate New York, the son of a Coast Guardsman and a housewife, whom I call Mom and Dad. Dad's job moved him around the country every four years, so as a kid I lived in Florida, Massachusettes, Lousiana, Washington, Florida again, Washington again... it kinda repeats from here. We adopted special needs kids while we were growing up, which made things interesting. <br><br>

            The twenties were kinda blurry, mostly because of my then calling as Seattle's best karaoke host. Kara, meaning empty, and oke, the abbreviation for okesutura - orchestra. Now you know. Anyway, it involved a lot of bribes, most of which came in the form of Jagermeister. Hence the blur. <br><br>

            Eventually I went back to the University of Washington to finish my degree. I never declared a major the first time I went, as it lasted all of a year. Fourteen years wiser, however, I decided archaeology would be a smashing good major. In many ways it was, just not in the 'let's have a productive career' way. <br><br>

            <img style="float: left; margin: 0px 20px;" src="img/joshjump.jpg" width="250" />It did, however, take me to Indonesia, where I spent a semester digging in the remote Banda Islands, 15 hours away by boat from anything resembling a city. It was life changing in a bunch of ways. Up until that point I thought Canada was exotic. I fell in love with the people, the food, and island life in general. I knew I wasn't done with the place - or rather, it wasn't done with me.<br><br>

            After I got my degree, I spent a summer shovelbumming at construction sites - basically looking through the dirt the excavators dig up, making sure there're no burial grounds under the new condos. I got to say I was an honest-to-God archaeologist, and that felt good. But I still missed Indonesia, and it was only summer work. <br><br>

            So, I went back, as an English teacher. My interview was laughably short; they wanted to make sure I was of the caucasian persuasion and that I knew Jakarta wasn't exactly a tropical paradise. Many teachers went expecting Bali. It's not. But I loved every minute of it. <br><br>

            Five years later, I came back to the states with a ton of stories to tell and a beautiful wife on my arm. Managing restaurants wasn't for me, so I decided to write a book. The rest is history. <br><br>

            Or will be, once I get to it.
